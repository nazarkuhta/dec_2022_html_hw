        <p>Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born Feburary 23 or April 1, 1980)is the mischievous, rebellious,
            misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He
            is the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been
            nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous
            comics, such as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a
            100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt
            Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

            Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series,
            he has discovered a new comet which was named after him, and he also has performed in a successful band
            with Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.</p>
