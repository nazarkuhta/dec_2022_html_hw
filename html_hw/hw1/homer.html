        <p>Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956) is a man from Springfield. He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and
            father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds), lazy, and often
            ignorant to the world around him. Although he has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and
            even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't.

            His favorite color is blue, and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down
            arcade racer, playing the piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney
            Train" and "Ride the Champion Mechanical Horse".

            Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he
            is often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern
            with his friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found
            sitting on the couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only
            son of Abraham Simpson II and Mona Simpson. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even
            though he mutually hates his wife's sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to
            adopt Ling and agreed to be the minister for Patty's intended homosexual marriage. As a result of this,
            Homer is her legal adoptive father.Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements
            and experiences in his life. He has won a Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and
            saved Springfield many times.</p>
